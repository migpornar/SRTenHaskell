In the present work, we will discuss about the rewriting systems and
their properties. In the first part, we will focus on defining
elements needed to give a first definition of rewriting systems. Also,
we will be announce some interesting properties that will be extremely
important in later chapters.

With the definition of rewriting systems, we will give answer to their
two principal problems, terminating and confluence. For the
terminating problem, we will be trying to adapt the definition of
rewriting system to a Turing machine, and use Turing machine
properties to solve our problem. For the confluence problem, we will
study the situations when we doubt the confluence occurs, specifically
we will discuss about the critical pairs.

Finally, we will give two algorithm that transform our system without
the properties we discuss above.
